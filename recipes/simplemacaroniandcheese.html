        <h2>How to Make Macaroni and Cheese on the Stovetop</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Boil Macaroni</h3>
                <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Make a Roux</h3>
                <p>While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Add Cheese and Macaroni</h3>
                <p>Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</p>
