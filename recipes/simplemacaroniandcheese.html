    <h2>Description</h2>

        You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Make Macaroni and Cheese on the Stovetop</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li><h4>Boil Macaroni</h4>
            <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Make a Roux</h4>
            <p>While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Add Cheese and Macaroni</h4>
            <p>Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="description">Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</p>
